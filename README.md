# Learning Jenkins

I have created this repo to learn Jenkins. Here I will create code to test and automate with Jenkins. Mostly I would work with Django, Gunicorn and NGINX stack. 

Here I am using Ubuntu 22.04 system with Jenkins installed Version 2.452.2.
Also further, I am going to test and automate Jenkins with Docker and Kubernates.

    CI/CD is a method of frequently delivering apps to customers by intoducing automation into
    stages of app development.

## What is CI / CD / CD - 

    * CI - Continous Integration - Build -> Test -> Merge the code
